These files are part of my final project of numerical methods.

The files bio-NN.py, CoÃÅdigoEjemplo02.py and NNAproxEDO are examples of the use of ANN to solve ODE's.
To run the codes you need to install autograd. You can use the command:
pip install autograd

The report of the project is the file Proyecto Final.pdf (spanish).
